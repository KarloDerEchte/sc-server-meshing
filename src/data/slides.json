Updating each game object requires a certain amount of instructions to perform its simulation logic. For example, their change in position and orientation in the game world, as well as other state attributes of the object (e.g. a door might be in an open, close, opening or closing state).",

And we \"only\" have e.g. 4.0GHz = 4.000.000.000 clock cycles (and thus instructions) per second available? This means we are limited in the amount of instructions per second. And this consequently means we are also limited in the number of game objects we can update and simulate. Although, the number of instructions a game object requires may vary, as it depends on the complexity of the game object.",

We are not allowed to skip the update of game objects as that would seemingly \"freeze\" parts of the game world. Instead, the next round of updates for ALL game objects is delayed.

There are hard limits to hardware and better hardware becomes exponentially more expensive as well. Using better hardware is called vertical scaling.",

These code instructions alter the data, turning that data from one state into another state. And depending on the processor architecture, cores and clock speed (e.g. 4.8GHz) there can be multiple billion instructions executed per second. Those results are then send over a network and/or used to create an image on our monitor screens.",

In the context of a videogame, these could be the position x and the velocity vx of our player character. So the computer calculated our character's next position in the level.

Not even the most powerful computer will be capable of providing that much memory and computational power on its own.",
            "Therefore, the load has to be distributed onto multiple computers/CPUs and connected over a network, to let the computers communicate and exchange only the currently relevant data with each other. Mainly the game servers need this functionality while the players only need to connect to a small amount of game servers at any given point in time and load and compute only the entities close to them. Such a system is generally called a Server Mesh, because multiple servers are being meshed together over a network (local or over the internet). That makes multiple computers act as one large one with a lot of memory and lots of computation power. This is the system Star Citizen plans to utilize to create its vast and rich universe."

While waiting for the server network updates to come back, the client will use information from the previous entity state updates send from the server (essentially the entities' last known actions) to simulate and therefore predict the entities behavior. Later, the network update from the server will be used to ensure its correctness and correct the client's entities state if necessary. This solution helps with creating a smoother experience for the client while benefiting from the server verification at the same time."

            "The game loop is executed by the CPU, not the GPU. That is because the game code and game logic is executed on the CPU. If there was no game loop, then no changes would happen in the game, and the GPU would only ever render the same image/frame with no changes over and over again. Only because of the game loop, it is made possible that objects change state in the game world. The CPU periodically sends the current information of the objects of the game world to the GPU to have it create a new image. This is done by the renderer, also running on the CPU, which optimizes the scene data before it is send to the GPU. There are a few tricks like Interpolation to have smooth motion of objects at high frame rates even if the game loop only runs at 30 ticks per second.",
            "Since the game servers only need to simulated the game world, they just run the game loop without rendering the game (which actually frees up some CPU load because the CPU does not have to tell the GPU what it is supposed to render). Thus there usually is no GPU installed in the computer configuration of game servers.",
            "Note: Sometimes the game tick rate on the server is referred to as frame rate as well. Frame here refers to a frame of time or execution, and not an image.",
            "Every game has a game loop in its code to simulate that time has passed in the game world. In each game loop cycle, called a \"game tick\", all/some objects in the game world are being updated as well as the inputs of the players handled to have an effects in the game world. In many games, the game loop is set to 30 ticks per second (every 33.3 milliseconds one tick), in some highly competitive games up to 64 and even 128 ticks per second to allow for the reaction time of players to matter more. The game tick rate is usually independent from the frame rate.",
            "The frame rate is usually determined by how many images/frames the render engine and the GPU can create within one second. This is usually determined by a lot of factors, like what the renderer and GPU are capable of, how many objects are on screen, in which ways the objects are being rendered, etc. At 24+ frames per second (fps), the brain is tricked into seeing motion. In recent years, especially in the competitive gaming scenes, monitor screens allow for 144fps and more. Of course, the GPU still has to be capable of providing these high frame amounts first before they can be displayed."

            "The game world is usually created out of static objects. These objects are usually floors, walls, ceilings, stairs, planet surface, etc. These static objects are pure geometry and do not have any special behavior attached to them (except maybe a separate hitbox for collision checks) and therefore do not have to be updated in the update loop at all. Thus, they are very cheap objects CPU computation-wise and merely need to be rendered on the GPU.",
            "However, games usually feature dynamic objects as well, like players, NPCs, ships, other vehicles, doors, etc. Essentially everything that moves, interacts or has behaviors are considered dynamic objects. They are usually referred to as entities (entity in singular) and are the ones which are updated in the game loop on the CPU.",
            "Based on the number of game tick per second the game runs on, the CPU only has a few milliseconds to go through all entities that require an update and update them. Star Citizen has a tick rate of 30 and therefore 33 milliseconds (ms) computation time available for each game tick. Usually a modern computer can handle a few thousand entities depending on the complexity of those entities. When there are too many entities or too many complex entities being updated, then the game starts to slow down which can have a noticeable impact on the player experience. Therefore, the goal is to keep the entity computation low enough for a smooth experience by staying under those 33ms for each game tick.",
            "As we will see later, Star Citizen reworked its entity system to an Entity Component architecture and splits each individual behavior in the game into its own component which then can be attributed to any entity. Therefore, it matters how many components are being updated in the game update loop, not necessarily the amount of entities."

We are going to revisit this example in the upcoming major technologies again.",

The load on the CPU (blue) and GPU (red), how much RAM (orange) is in use, which part of the drive we loaded into memory (grey area). In this case the data of all objects were loaded from drive into memory, the load of CPU and GPU and memory occupied is quite high. (In the context of Server Meshing, the GPU is not as relevant as the CPU and memory.)",

Therefore, we would only ever need to load the parts of the level into memory which are near and visible to the player (like a few kilometer sphere around the player) instead of having to load the entire level from drive into memory. This allows the game to keep memory consumption low enough to not exceed the maximum memory capacity.",

The player client and game server still had to load all objects of the level at its initial load because there was no logic yet that would tell client and server which objects it should load or unload. The functionality for streaming objects in and out of a level at any time became only possible with the introduction of Object Container Streaming which we will talk more about later."

CPU and memory loads are now reduced on the server, allowing more objects to be added into the level again. The server sends periodic queries to a database to check if objects around players are about to come into view. If that is the case the server will lookup the Object Container identifier of those objects and load the object into its memory.",

Most computation intensive areas (like landing zones) were always populated by players and thus are usually never unloaded. Load was still high on the servers.

Essentially, that specific section of the world is frozen in time until a player moves back into that area again. That is not ideal in a simulated, immersive and economy driven universe.",
            "To solve this, in the future, another server/service will take those unloaded areas and quickly simulate the time that has passed. This way, the computation resources required are greatly reduced by abstracting the simulation to a minimum. The universe would still appear alive. For example, NPCs who are busy repairing a ship wont have to be simulated running around and doing their job if no player is around to witness them doing it, only the ship hull values have to be increased in the database in the background. When a player enters the area again, the ship will be in a more repaired state compared to when the player left the area. Meanwhile, the NPCs are loaded back into the area again as if they were busy the entire time, even thought they did not actually exist to work on repairing the ship. This way, the entire universe will always feel alive, even thought most of the universe won't even be actively loaded and computed on the game servers themselves. This feature heavily relies on Global Persistence to be completed, since values have to be update in the database, then accessed and loaded into memory by the game servers. Simulating the game world on a higher abstraction level is also going to be the main functionality of the \"Quantum\" Economy Simulator.",
            "Another major future feature of Server OCS relying on Full Persistence as well will be Server Recovery. Once all states of all entities are continuously persisted into a database it becomes possible to recover a server after a crash. If a crash happens, a new server can be started in its place, the database provides the information about the entities that were present on the server at the time of the crash, load those entities back into memory via Server OCS and connect the player clients back to the server again. Therefore, in case of a server crash, players would only have to experience a couple seconds of interruption and barely any loss of progress in the game before being able to continue playing the game again where they left off."

Even though the goal is a single game world, a single shard, until Server Meshing provides the performance for this, there will still exist multiple game worlds in parallel. Therefore, initially players have to be able to move between game worlds, determined by matchmaking whenever they log-out and back in. In this case, the player items need to move with our player characters between game worlds. The Global Database enables this capability and makes our data accessible to all game worlds.",
            "The game now differentiates between stowed and unstowed items. When an items exist physicalized in the game world, it is an unstowed item and is stored in the EntityGraph database of that game world. When an item exists inside inventories or are un/despawned ships - and therefore only interactable from the UI - then they are considered stowed items and are stored in the Global Database instead.",
            "Therefore, whenever items are moved into an inventory, its node (e.g. Gun #9001 in the image) is removed from the EntityGraph database and a new entry is created into the Global Database (e.g. into the Inventory of Box #123). If an item is taken out of an inventory or a ship is spawned, then it is removed from the Global Database and a new node is created in the EntityGraph (an edge as well)."

            "Ideally, all of these services will be designed in a way that allows them to be horizontally scaled, meaning they can be copied and distributed onto more than one data center. Or they all receive their own cache layer. To achieve a good performance, databases have to be replicated onto multiple data centers across the globe for all game server to have quick access. This also enables redundancy, basically the data is present in multiple identical databases, which in case of a database crash, a new database can quickly be spun up in its place by replicating the data from one of the other, still running databases. This might allow for one single world-wide instance where all players from around the world are able to play together without major interruptions and lag since there will always be a database server near a game server.",
            "Theoretically, with later versions of Dynamic Server Meshing, game servers and Replicant and Gateway services could be geographically re-positioned on-the-fly to another data center where the latency of the currently connected players is the most similar to create a fair playing field for all players by reducing the chance of issues like peekers advantage from occurring. In general, as long as latency is stable and there is not a lot of jitter, code systems like lag compensation can guarantee a smooth and fair player experience even with higher latency to servers."

Even tho the game servers might be fine, the CPU/GPU computation on the player client might exceed its limits, resulting in dropping performance.",
            "One way to push performance on the client would be to skip network updates and simulation for further away objects to reduce the network bandwidth (Entity Component Update Scheduler can be improved to enable this). In terms of rendering, using the same, low level LOD asset for all far away player characters and vehicles would help with the rendering performance on the GPU (which may look worse but would still give the sense of a large, active crowd). But depending on the size of the crowd and the amount of objects, the experience might still not be great.",
            "A drastic but simple workaround would be to limit the amount of objects to a small radius around the player (leading objects to pop-in and pop-out of existence in the distance), lookdown certain game areas via game mechanics (close jumppoints, NPC blockade, et.) or to create layers (parallel instances?) of the same area, taking into account friend and foe of players, but both of these solutions would have severe implications for gameplay that would need to be worked around.",
            "Anyways, in case of such a rare edge case scenario, this quickly goes into the realm of major speculation with lots of possible solutions, so I guess we will leave it here and know more once that point is reached. For the overwhelming majority of situations in the game, the system of Dynamic Server Meshing is expected to perform very well, because other players and objects will be hidden inside buildings and ships and therefore can be hidden from the player client and reduce memory, CPU and GPU load to feasible levels without the need of workarounds."

Many smaller bugs that had caused timing errors to grow on long-running servers were also fixed. The network synchronization of vehicles and physics objects were updated to take full advantage of the improvements. The accumulated result of all these changes was a significant reduction in latency and desynchronization issues in many areas, even under harsh test conditions for network and server performance.

            "* since Star Citizen universe plans to feature 9 times more NPCs than players as its population, with NPCs being able to perform most jobs and going about their daily lives, the game needs an extensive AI system to accomplish that",

            "Goals:",
            "* create a high-level, bottom-up, behavior-based, objective-oriented NPC system",
            "* let NPCs traverse the game world and perform various actions by making decisions based on their surroundings",
            "Approach:",
            "* more complex tasks/behaviors are build out of multiple simpler sub-tasks/sub-behaviour, creating a \"behavior tree\"",
            "* sub-behaviors are organized into a hierarchy of layers with each layer implementing a particular level of competence.",
            "* Higher levels are able to subsume (integrate/combine) lower levels",
            "* for example if the NPC requires an item then it would 1) search for the item 2) explore the area 3) walk around 4) avoid obstacles. In this case, the higher-level \"explore the area\" would utilize the lower-level competencies like \"avoid obstacles\".",
            "* the NPC is able to adapt to new information while in the process of performing an action by constantly taking in information about the surroundings to then select an appropriate action in a bottom-up fashion",
            "* each individual behavior does not make the NPC look intelligent, only the interaction of multiple behaviors within the environment does",
            "* the Bartender NPCs are a result of this AI system, a first test for various behaviors by interacting with the game world, players and other NPCs",
            "* with server meshing, the NPCs will have to be able to look into multiple servers to make realistic actions",
            "* (speculation: all NPCs will run on their own game server that acts as a client and NPCs communicate back and forth with the game server similar to how player clients do it. this would allow them to look into multiple servers as well)"
