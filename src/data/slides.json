And we \"only\" have e.g. 4.0GHz = 4.000.000.000 clock cycles (and thus instructions) per second available? This means we are limited in the amount of instructions per second. And this consequently means we are also limited in the number of game objects we can update and simulate. Although, the number of instructions a game object requires may vary, as it depends on the complexity of the game object.",

There are hard limits to hardware and better hardware becomes exponentially more expensive as well. Using better hardware is called vertical scaling.",
            "Another and more promising option is horizontal scaling. Here, we simply use another CPU, an additional computer. By using multiple computers, each one with a CPU, connecting them via a network and having them exchange relevant data, they can work on a much larger workload.",
            "If done right, as in having solved memory management, loading of data (memory is still limited resource on each machine, so as the game world grows not every game object needs to be loaded into memory), game simulation (a game object doesnt have to be simulated on all machines, but just one), networking (data is only send to computers that need it) and persistence (read and write data in databases for later use), then you have huge amounts of processing power at your finger tips. You could execute trillions of instructions across hundreds of computers/servers each second and simulate a large, game object-rich game world.",

            "In general, all computer components have their own limitations. Memory (drives and RAM) are limited by how much maximum data capacity they have as well as how fast they can read and write data (and if they are volatile or not). Meanwhile, processing units (CPUs and GPUs) are mostly about how many code instructions they can execute each second, as well as how fast they are able to access the data from the memory devices.",
            "With these limitations all software is created, games included. CIG set out to create a large universe with thousands of players, NPCs and other entities which all require to be in memory and need to be computed by the CPU in the game loop (and rendered on the GPU). Not even the most powerful computer will be capable of providing that much memory and computational power on its own.",
            "Therefore, the load has to be distributed onto multiple computers/CPUs and connected over a network, to let the computers communicate and exchange only the currently relevant data with each other. Mainly the game servers need this functionality while the players only need to connect to a small amount of game servers at any given point in time and load and compute only the entities close to them. Such a system is generally called a Server Mesh, because multiple servers are being meshed together over a network (local or over the internet). That makes multiple computers act as one large one with a lot of memory and lots of computation power. This is the system Star Citizen plans to utilize to create its vast and rich universe."

The clients can connect themselves to the server and then the server and the clients can exchange information over the network between each other. Clients don't establish connections between each other, and instead all clients are connected to the server. The server distributes/relays the information from one client to the other clients.",

The game server runs just another instance of the game, just like the player game clients. However, the server instance is special because it does not actually act as a player. The server simulates the game world while listening to the incoming actions from the player clients, then sends the resulting changes back to all clients which will then in turn update their own game world accordingly.",

            "Every game has a game loop in its code to simulate that time has passed in the game world. In each game loop cycle, called a \"game tick\", all/some objects in the game world are being updated as well as the inputs of the players handled to have an effects in the game world. In many games, the game loop is set to 30 ticks per second (every 33.3 milliseconds one tick), in some highly competitive games up to 64 and even 128 ticks per second to allow for the reaction time of players to matter more. The game tick rate is usually independent from the frame rate.",
            "The frame rate is usually determined by how many images/frames the render engine and the GPU can create within one second. This is usually determined by a lot of factors, like what the renderer and GPU are capable of, how many objects are on screen, in which ways the objects are being rendered, etc. At 24+ frames per second (fps), the brain is tricked into seeing motion. In recent years, especially in the competitive gaming scenes, monitor screens allow for 144fps and more. Of course, the GPU still has to be capable of providing these high frame amounts first before they can be displayed.",
            "The game loop is executed by the CPU, not the GPU. That is because the game code and game logic is executed on the CPU. If there was no game loop, then no changes would happen in the game, and the GPU would only ever render the same image/frame with no changes over and over again. Only because of the game loop, it is made possible that objects change state in the game world. The CPU periodically sends the current information of the objects of the game world to the GPU to have it create a new image. This is done by the renderer, also running on the CPU, which optimizes the scene data before it is send to the GPU. There are a few tricks like Interpolation to have smooth motion of objects at high frame rates even if the game loop only runs at 30 ticks per second.",
            "Since the game servers only need to simulated the game world, they just run the game loop without rendering the game (which actually frees up some CPU load because the CPU does not have to tell the GPU what it is supposed to render). Thus there usually is no GPU installed in the computer configuration of game servers.",
            "Note: Sometimes the game tick rate on the server is referred to as frame rate as well. Frame here refers to a frame of time or execution, and not an image."

These objects are usually floors, walls, ceilings, stairs, planet surface, etc. These static objects are pure geometry and do not have any special behavior attached to them (except maybe a separate hitbox for collision checks) and therefore do not have to be updated in the update loop at all. Thus, they are very cheap objects CPU computation-wise and merely need to be rendered on the GPU.",
            "However, games usually feature dynamic objects as well, like players, NPCs, ships, other vehicles, doors, etc. Essentially everything that moves, interacts or has behaviors are considered dynamic objects. They are usually referred to as entities (entity in singular) and are the ones which are updated in the game loop on the CPU.",
            "Based on the number of game tick per second the game runs on, the CPU only has a few milliseconds to go through all entities that require an update and update them. Star Citizen has a tick rate of 30 and therefore 33 milliseconds (ms) computation time available for each game tick. Usually a modern computer can handle a few thousand entities depending on the complexity of those entities. When there are too many entities or too many complex entities being updated, then the game starts to slow down which can have a noticeable impact on the player experience. Therefore, the goal is to keep the entity computation low enough for a smooth experience by staying under those 33ms for each game tick.",

We are going to revisit this example in the upcoming major technologies again.",

The load on the CPU (blue) and GPU (red), how much RAM (orange) is in use, which part of the drive we loaded into memory (grey area). In this case the data of all objects were loaded from drive into memory, the load of CPU and GPU and memory occupied is quite high. (In the context of Server Meshing, the GPU is not as relevant as the CPU and memory.)",

Therefore, we would only ever need to load the parts of the level into memory which are near and visible to the player (like a few kilometer sphere around the player) instead of having to load the entire level from drive into memory. This allows the game to keep memory consumption low enough to not exceed the maximum memory capacity.",

The functionality for streaming objects in and out of a level at any time became only possible with the introduction of Object Container Streaming which we will talk more about later."

Essentially, that specific section of the world is frozen in time until a player moves back into that area again. That is not ideal in a simulated, immersive and economy driven universe.",
            "To solve this, in the future, another server/service will take those unloaded areas and quickly simulate the time that has passed. This way, the computation resources required are greatly reduced by abstracting the simulation to a minimum. The universe would still appear alive. For example, NPCs who are busy repairing a ship wont have to be simulated running around and doing their job if no player is around to witness them doing it, only the ship hull values have to be increased in the database in the background. When a player enters the area again, the ship will be in a more repaired state compared to when the player left the area. Meanwhile, the NPCs are loaded back into the area again as if they were busy the entire time, even thought they did not actually exist to work on repairing the ship. This way, the entire universe will always feel alive, even thought most of the universe won't even be actively loaded and computed on the game servers themselves. This feature heavily relies on Global Persistence to be completed, since values have to be update in the database, then accessed and loaded into memory by the game servers. Simulating the game world on a higher abstraction level is also going to be the main functionality of the \"Quantum\" Economy Simulator.",

Once all states of all entities are continuously persisted into a database it becomes possible to recover a server after a crash. If a crash happens, a new server can be started in its place, the database provides the information about the entities that were present on the server at the time of the crash, load those entities back into memory via Server OCS and connect the player clients back to the server again. Therefore, in case of a server crash, players would only have to experience a couple seconds of interruption and barely any loss of progress in the game before being able to continue playing the game again where they left off."

But now, most of those players are moving over to a location near the top right of the right planet.

This also enables redundancy, basically the data is present in multiple identical databases, which in case of a database crash, a new database can quickly be spun up in its place by replicating the data from one of the other, still running databases.

Even tho the game servers might be fine, the CPU/GPU computation on the player client might exceed its limits, resulting in dropping performance.",

In terms of rendering, using the same, low level LOD asset for all far away player characters and vehicles would help with the rendering performance on the GPU (which may look worse but would still give the sense of a large, active crowd). But depending on the size of the crowd and the amount of objects, the experience might still not be great.",

Many smaller bugs that had caused timing errors to grow on long-running servers were also fixed. The network synchronization of vehicles and physics objects were updated to take full advantage of the improvements. The accumulated result of all these changes was a significant reduction in latency and desynchronization issues in many areas, even under harsh test conditions for network and server performance.
